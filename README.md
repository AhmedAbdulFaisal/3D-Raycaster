# 3D-Raycaster
Rudimentary 3D raycaster made in C with openGL

To build, make sure you compile raycaster.c

the textures are encoded in .ppm files and it should work with any linux distribution. The premise of the game is nonexistent, it's merely a raycaster demo. Can it be made into a Wolfenstien 3D clone, who knows.
