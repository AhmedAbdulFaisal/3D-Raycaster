Here is a full Raycaster made with SDL C++. This isn't necessarily actual 3D, but is pseudo-2D rendering with most of the rendering code derived from https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html. The game will be updated as time goes on, so please check the releases page to keep up.

All game releases (until further notice) are compiled on a Linux machine. If you want to download the source or play with the builds, you need a linux machine to build from source and execute the program (It has no filename extension).
